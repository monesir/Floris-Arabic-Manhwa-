# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-18)

**Core value:** Reading from selected sources and managing a personal manhwa library must feel reliable, organized, and local-first without requiring any account or cloud dependency.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Source Browse MVP

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Source Browse MVP)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to discuss and plan
Last activity: 2026-05-18 - Completed Phase 1 Foundation Shell

Progress: [###-------] 18%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 18 min
- Total execution time: 0.9 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | 55 min | 18 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 9 min, 29 min, 17 min
- Trend: Stable with moderate integration complexity

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Use Electron and a Windows-first delivery target.
- Initialization: Use a vertical MVP roadmap instead of horizontal layer-first planning.
- Initialization: Design sources as both built-in adapters and external plugins.
- Phase 1 planning: Use a real shell with smart placeholders and full navigation from day one.
- Phase 1 planning: Use a minimal real persistence schema instead of browser-only storage.
- Phase 1 planning: Treat built-in plugin runtime and external plugin validation as separate Phase 1 concerns.
- 01-01 execution: Use a real pnpm workspace with `apps/desktop` as the shell root.
- 01-01 execution: Keep the full navigation map visible now through intentional placeholder pages instead of hiding later routes.
- 01-02 execution: Use built-in `node:sqlite` for the local database because the native `better-sqlite3` path failed against the current Electron runtime.
- 01-02 execution: Use `process.env.ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL` and `../renderer/index.html` as the main-window loading path expected by `electron-vite@5`.
- 01-03 execution: Use a capability-driven shared source contract and registry-backed Plugins page.
- 01-03 execution: Discover external plugins from the app user-data `plugins` directory while keeping external runtime execution deferred.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Source extraction details for `azoramoon.com` and `olympustaff.com` still need phase-level validation before implementation.
- `node:sqlite` is still experimental upstream and should be reassessed later if Electron or packaging requirements change.
- External plugin runtime hardening remains intentionally deferred even though discovery and validation now exist.
